"""Pickler for values, functions, and classes.

Pickles created by the pickling library contain non-ASCII characters, so
we base64-encode the results so that we can put them in a JSON objects.
The pickler is used to embed FlatMap callable objects into the workflow JSON
description.

The pickler module should be used to pickle functions and modules; for values,
the coders.*PickleCoder classes should be used instead.
