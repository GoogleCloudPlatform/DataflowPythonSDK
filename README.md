# Google Cloud Dataflow SDK for Python

Google Cloud Dataflow SDK for Python is based on [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org) and targeted for executing Python pipelines on Google Cloud Dataflow.

## Getting Started

* [Quickstart Using Python](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-python) on Google Cloud Dataflow
* [API Reference](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/pydoc/)
* [Examples](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples)

## We moved to Apache Beam!
Google Cloud Dataflow for Python is now Apache Beam Python SDK and the code development moved to the [Apache Beam repo](https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/python).
